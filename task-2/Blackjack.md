# Task 2

1. Single Responsibility Principle: BlackjackGUI class should have one and only one reason to change, ie, Blackjack.
2. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level classes shouldn't have to change because low-level classes changed. eg: Any change in Card does no change Blackjack.
3. Interface Segregation Principle: A class that implements an interface shouldn't be forced to implement methods it does not use. eg: Blackjack does not consider Iterable.
