# Task 2

1. Single Responsibility Principle: BlackjackGUI class should has one and only one reason to change, ie, Blackjack.
2. Liskov Substitution Principle: When extending a class, consider that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.
3. Interface Segregation Principle: A class that implements an interface shouldn't be forced to implement methods it does not use. eg: Blackjack does not consider Iterable.
