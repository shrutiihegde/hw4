# Task 1

1. Open/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. eg: Book/DVD can extend Product
2. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level classes shouldn't have to change because low-level classes changed. eg: Shelf shouldn't have to change because of Book/DVD.
